There are several techniques to correct the motion artifact, but these techniques cannot correct the motion during scanning. The aim of this study is to develop a sinogram-based motion correction (SBMC) method to correct directly the head motion during PET scanning using a motion tracking system and list-mode data acquisition. This method is a rebinning procedure by which the lines of response (LOR) are geometrically transformed according to the current values of the six-dimensional motion data. Michelogram was recomposed using rebinned LOR and motion corrected sinogram was generated. In the motion corrected image, the blurring artifact due to motion was reduced by SBMC method.","Year":2002,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1239453"},{"name":"A fault tolerant control architecture for automated highway systems","snippet":"A hierarchical controller for dealing with faults and adverse environmental conditions on an automated highway system is proposed.

A uniform source ensures that any anomalies in performance are artifacts of the FLIR being tested and not the tester. Achieving a uniform source from a resistor array based portable infrared scene projector requires implementation of nonuniformity correction algorithms instead of controlling the bonding integrity of a source to a cooler, and the coating properties of the source typical of a conventional blackbody. The necessity to perform the non-uniformity correction on the scene projector is because the source is a two-dimensional array comprised of discrete resistive emitters. Ideally, each emitter of the array would have the same resistance and thus produce the same output for a given drive current. However, there are small variations from emitter to emitter over the thousands of emitters that comprise an array. Once a uniform output is achieved then the output must be calibrated for the system to be used as test equipment. Since the radiance emitted from the monolithic array is created by flowing current through micro resistors, a radiometric approach is used to calibrate the differential output of the scene projector over its dynamic range. The focus of this paper is to describe the approach and results of implementing non-uniformity correction and calibration on a portable infrared scene projector.","Year":2002,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1047880"},{"name":"The Two-Level-Turn-Model Fault-Tolerant Routing Scheme in Tori with Convex and Concave Faults","snippet":"A kind of routing scheme with the ability to tolerate the faults is necessary in the massively parallel multiprocessors.

The new routing scheme is called the two-level-turn-model routing scheme, which is based on our investigation of the fault-tolerant properties of the turn-model. Through employing two specific kinds of turn model, our routing scheme could tolerate the convex faults and the concave faults both with a few limitations to their shape. At most five virtual channels would be used to avoid the deadlock occurrence in the tori, no matter whether the fault regions are connected and no matter where the faults locate. Actually, if the fault regions encompass no physical boundary nodes in the tori, totally four virtual channels, each pair for each turn model, would be sufficient to preclude the occurrence of the deadlock. At last, the simulation shows the effectiveness of our scheme.","Year":2009,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5070601"},{"name":"Slicing and dicing bugs in concurrent programs","snippet":"A lack of scalable verification tools for concurrent programs has not allowed concurrent software development to keep abreast with hardware trends in multi-core technologies. The growing complexity of modern concurrent systems necessitates the use of abstractions in order to verify all the expected behaviors of the system. Current abstraction refinement techniques are restricted to verifying mostly sequential and simpler concurrent programs. In this work, we present a novel incremental underapproximation technique that uses program slicing. Based on a reachability property, an initial backward slice for a single thread is generated. The information in the program slice is coupled with a concrete execution to drive the lone thread; generating an underapproximation of the program behavior space. If the target location is reached in the underapproximation, then we have an actual concrete trace. Otherwise, the initial single-thread slice is refined to include another thread that affects the reachability of the target location. In this case, the concrete execution only considers the two threads in the slice and preemption points between the threads only occur at locations in the slice. This refinement process is repeated until the target location is reached or is shown to be unreachable. Initial results indicate that the incremental technique can potentially allow the discovery of errors in larger systems using fewer resources and produce a better reduction in systems that are correct.","Year":2010,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062158"},{"name":"Cross-layer error resilience for robust systems","snippet":"A large class of robust electronic systems of the future must be designed to perform correctly despite hardware failures.

Therefore, determination of which software testing phases to focus improvements work on, has considerable industrial interest. This paper evaluates the use of five different techniques, namely particle swarm optimization based artificial neural networks (PSO-ANN), artificial immune recognition systems (AIRS), gene expression programming (GEP), genetic programming (GP) and multiple regression (MR), for predicting the number of faults slipping through unit, function, integration and system testing phases. The objective is to quantify improvement potential in different testing phases by striving towards finding the right faults in the right phase. We have conducted an empirical study of two large projects from a telecommunication company developing mobile platforms and wireless semiconductors. The results are compared using simple residuals, goodness of fit and absolute relative error measures. They indicate that the four search-based techniques (PSO-ANN, AIRS, GEP, GP) perform better than multiple regression for predicting the fault-slip-through for each of the four testing phases. At the unit and function testing phases, AIRS and PSO-ANN performed better while GP performed better at integration and system testing phases. The study concludes that a variety of search-based techniques are applicable for predicting the improvement potential in different testing phases with GP showing more consistent performance across two of the four test phases.","Year":2010,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635180"},{"name":"Error visualization of tetrahedral subdivision approach for trilinear interpolation","snippet":"A linear interpolation scheme inside a tetrahedral cell often causes a large interpolation error when field values change drastically.

Automatic discovery of masqueraders is sometimes undertaken by detecting significant departures from normal user behavior, as represented by a user profile formed from system audit data. A major obstacle for this type of research is the difficulty in obtaining such system audit data, largely due to privacy concerns. An immense contribution in this regard has been made by Schonlau et al., who have made available UNIX command-line data from 50+ users collected over a number of months. Most of the research in this area has made use of this dataset, so this paper takes as its point of departure the Schonlau et al. dataset and a recent series of experiments with this data framed by the same researchers . In extending that work with a new classification algorithm, a 56% improvement in masquerade detection was achieved at a corresponding false-alarm rate of 1.3%. In addition, encouraging results were obtained at a more realistic sequence length of 10 commands (as opposed to sequences of 100 commands used by Schonlau et al.). A detailed error analysis, based on an alternative configuration of the same data, reveals a serious flaw in this type of data which hinders masquerade detection and indicates some steps that need to be taken to improve future results. The error analysis also demonstrates the insights that can be gained by inspecting decision errors, instead of concentrating only on decision successes.","Year":2004,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282170"},{"name":"Fabric defect detection based on open source computer vision library OpenCV","snippet":"A method for fabric defect detection based on OpenCV with rich computer vision and image processing algorithms and functions is presented.

The machine is organized as a three-dimensional mesh containing many thousands of nodes and the routing method should tolerate a few percent of the nodes being faulty. There has been much work on routing methods for meshes that route messages around faults or regions of faults. The new method is to declare certain nonfaulty nodes to be \"lambs.\" A lamb is used for routing but not processing, so a lamb is neither the source nor the destination of a message. The lambs are chosen so that every \"survivor node,\" a node that is neither faulty nor a lamb, can reach every survivor node by at most two rounds of dimension-ordered (such as e-cube) routing. An algorithm for finding a set of lambs is presented. The results of simulations on 2D and 3D meshes of various sizes with various numbers of random node faults are given. For example, on a 32  32  32 3D mesh with 3 percent random faults and using at most two rounds of e-cube routing for each message, the average number of lambs is less than 68, which is less than 7 percent of the number 983 of faults and less than 0.21 percent of the number 32,768 of nodes.","Year":2004,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1268400"},{"name":"Unreliability tracing technique for system components based on the fault tree analysis","snippet":"A new method is developed for tracing the unreliability contributions of system components and recognizing the system weak parts using the fault tree analysis (FTA).

First, adopting a parameterization technique, referred to as parametric FT (PFT), to fold equal subtrees (or basic events) in order to resort to a more compact FT representation. It is shown that parameterization can be conveniently adopted as well for dynamic gates. Second, PFT can be modularized and each module translated into a high level colored Petri net in the form of a stochastic well-formed net (SWN). SWN generate a lumped Markov chain and the saving in the dimension of the state space can be very substantial with respect to standard (non colored) Petri nets. Translation of PFT modules into SWN has proved to be very flexible, and various kinds of new dependencies can be easily accommodated.

A partial verification of the GCS specification resulted. Two modeling formalisms were used to evaluate the SRS and to determine strategies for avoiding design defects and system failures. Z was applied first to detect and remove ambiguity from a part of the natural language based (NL-based) GCS SRS. Next, statecharts and activity-charts were constructed to visualize the Z description and make it executable. Using this formalism, the system behavior was assessed under normal and abnormal conditions. Faults were seeded into the model (i.e., an executable specification) to probe how the system would perform. The result of our analysis revealed that it is beneficial to construct a complete and consistent specification using this method (Z-to-statecharts). We discuss the significance of this approach, compare our work with similar studies, and propose approaches for improving fault tolerance. Our findings indicate that one can better understand the implications of the system requirements using Z-statecharts approach to facilitate their specification and analysis. Consequently, this approach can help to avoid the problems that result when incorrectly specified artifacts (i.e., in this case requirements) force corrective rework","Year":2002,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=981660"},{"name":"Analysis of Hyperion data with the FLAASH atmospheric correction algorithm","snippet":"A combination of good spatial and spectral resolution make visible to shortwave infrared spectral imaging from aircraft or spacecraft a highly valuable technology for remote sensing of the Earth's surface.

Therefore the change of operation mode from grid connection to stand alone allows for uninterruptible supply of a selected part of grid connected load. However, in the stand alone operation mode the superior controllers should provide fixed amplitude and frequency of the generated voltage in spite of the load nature. Moreover, a soft transition from grid connection mode to stand alone operation requires that, the mains outage detection method must be applied. A grid voltage recovery requires change of the generator operational mode from stand alone to grid connection.

Wireless sensor networks have received increasing interest in recent years due to their usage in monitoring and data collection in a wide variety of environments like remote geographic locations, industrial plants, toxic locations, or even office buildings. Two of the most important issues related to a WN are their energy constraints and their potential for developing faults. A station is usually powered by a battery which cannot be recharged while on a mission. Hence, any protocol run by a WN should be energy-efficient. Moreover, it is possible that all stations deployed as part of a WN may not work perfectly. Hence, any protocol designed for a WN should work well even when some of the stations are faulty. The permutation routing problem is an abstraction of many routing problems in a wireless network. In an instance of the permutation routing problem, each of the p-stations in the network is the sender and recipient of n\/p packets. The task is to route the packets to their correct destinations. We consider the permutation routing problem in a single-hop wireless network, where each station is within the transmission range of all other stations. We design a protocol for permutation routing on a WN which is both energy efficient and fault tolerant. We present both theoretical estimates and extensive simulation results to show that our protocol is efficient in terms of energy expenditure at each node even when some of the nodes are faulty.

In order to promote detection rate, optimizing measures are also discussed.","Year":2009,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212305"},{"name":"Implementation of e-beam proximity effect correction using linear programming techniques for the fabrication of asymmetric bow-tie antennas","snippet":"Antenna-coupled tunnel junction diodes have recently been offering great advantages for IR and Terahertz detection applications. Fabrication has been a major constraint in our ability to field these devices. The first obstacle is the relatively small size of the antenna. As the length of the wave to be detected gets smaller, the size of the antenna shrinks according to the A\/4 rule. This eliminates the use of traditional photolithographic fabrication techniques, which fails in the nanometer geometry range. For this reason, e-beam lithographic technique is used. The second challenge appears in the fabrication of the tunnel junction. The tunnel junction part of the device is formed by sandwiching an insulation layer in between two conductor antenna parts. Previously, many fabrication techniques were offered for the vertical conductor-insulator-conductor (CIC) structures where two metal layers overlap each other forming a tunnel junction vertical to the antenna surface. However, planar CIC structures have become more popular because they enable the surface plasmon excitement across the tunnel junction barrier. The fabrication of planar tunnel junction requires the patterning of a nano-size gap that will enable the tunneling of the electrons in between two conductor antenna wings. At this critical location, e-beam proximity effect (pixel-to-pixel beam interactions) becomes a very important issue to be addressed in order to create a nanometer-range accuracy gap.","Year":2009,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5378016"},{"name":"Integrated fault-tolerant multicast and anycast routing algorithms","snippet":"Anycast is a new communication service defined in IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6 for the next generation). An anycast message is the one that should be delivered to the `nearest' member in a group of designated recipients. Anycast and multicast mechanisms may be integrated to provide better services. A group of replicated (or mirrored) servers that provides anycast service may also provide multicast services and needs multicast to consistently update, whereas anycast routing may help a multicast request to reach the `nearest' member in a multicast group. A novel integration routing protocol is presented for both multicast and anycast messages communications in the Internet. The protocol is composed of four algorithms: (1) dynamic anycast routing algorithm for efficient transmission of anycast messages over the Internet to a group of servers. (2) integrated anycast routing with core-based tree technique based on multicast routing algorithms taking advantage of short delay, high throughput and load sharing. (3) Fault-tolerant algorithms for both anycast and multicast routing using backup paths restoring techniques. The performance figures have demonstrated the benefits of anycast routing in reducing end-to-end packet delay, and attaining load balance and fault-tolerance for multicast","Year":2000,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=870981"},{"name":"Context-Aware Adaptive Applications: Fault Patterns and Their Automated Identification","snippet":"Applications running on mobile devices are intensely context-aware and adaptive. Streams of context values continuously drive these applications, making them very powerful but, at the same time, susceptible to undesired configurations. Such configurations are not easily exposed by existing validation techniques, thereby leading to new analysis and testing challenges. In this paper, we address some of these challenges by defining and applying a new model of adaptive behavior called an Adaptation Finite-State Machine (A-FSM) to enable the detection of faults caused by both erroneous adaptation logic and asynchronous updating of context information, with the latter leading to inconsistencies between the external physical context and its internal representation within an application. We identify a number of adaptation fault patterns, each describing a class of faulty behaviors. Finally, we describe three classes of algorithms to detect such faults automatically via analysis of the A-FSM. We evaluate our approach and the trade-offs between the classes of algorithms on a set of synthetically generated Context-Aware Adaptive Applications (CAAAs) and on a simple but realistic application in which a cell phone's configuration profile changes automatically as a result of changes to the user's location, speed, and surrounding environment. Our evaluation describes the faults our algorithms are able to detect and compares the algorithms in terms of their performance and storage requirements.","Year":2010,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432224"},{"name":"Edge Defect Detection in Ceramic Tile Based on Boundary Analysis Using Fuzzy Thresholding and Radon Transform","snippet":"Applying image processing technology and machine vision in industry have had significant development in recent decade.

The characteristics of arc, how it ignites, and what losses it may cause were discussed. The basic structure of AFDS and the primary principles of that AFDS detect arc fault were proposed. For efficiently realizing the global optimization, the single function problem of conventional arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) was solved by setting up a detection system. Composed with detectors, controllers and host computer database, system achieved the automatic detection of arc fault, high temperature fault and leakage current fault to protect the conductors, the equipments and ensure human's safety.

This technology imposes additional constraints on the layouts beyond traditional design rules. Of particular note is the requirement that all critical features be flanked by opposite-phase shifters while the shifters obey minimum width and spacing requirements. A layout is called phase assignable if it satisfies this requirement. Phase conflicts have to be removed to enable the use of AAPSM for layouts that are not phase assignable. Previous work has sought to detect a suitable set of phase conflicts to be removed as well as correct them. This paper has two key contributions: 1) a new computationally efficient approach to detect a minimal set of phase conflicts, which when corrected will produce a phase-assignable layout, and 2) a novel layout modification scheme for correcting these phase conflicts with small layout area increase. Unlike previous formulations of this problem, the proposed solution for the conflict detection problem does not frame it as a graph bipartization problem. Instead, a simpler and more computationally efficient reduction is proposed. This simplification greatly improves the runtime while maintaining the same improvements in the quality of results obtained in Chiang (Proc. DATE, 2005, p. 908). An average runtime speedup of 5.9times is achieved using the new flow. A new layout modification scheme suited for correcting phase conflicts in large standard-cell blocks is also proposed.

This article presents a new approach to this problem by simulating the good and fault circuits in Saber and introduces the general circuit fault simulation process.

Therefore, the number of faults assumed to exist in the software under test should be reduced. Fault collapsing is a common way of reducing the number of faults in hardware testing. However, this strategy can now be well implanted into the area of software testing. In this paper, we utilize the concept of fault dominance and equivalence, which has long been used in hardware testing, for revealing a novel way of reducing the number of faults assumed to hide in software systems. Once the number of faults assumed in software is decreased sharply, the effectiveness of mutation testing would be greatly enhanced.

A scatter correction algorithm is introduced that provides effective scatter correction but does not require additional patient exposure. The key hypothesis of the algorithm is that the high-frequency components of the X-ray spatial distribution do not result in strong high-frequency signals in the scatter. A calibration sheet with a checkerboard pattern of semitransparent blockers (a \"primary modulator\") is inserted between the X-ray source and the object. The primary distribution is partially modulated by a high-frequency function, while the scatter distribution still has dominant low-frequency components, based on the hypothesis. Filtering and demodulation techniques suffice to extract the low-frequency components of the primary and hence obtain the scatter estimation. The hypothesis was validated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and the algorithm was evaluated by both MC simulations and physical experiments. Reconstructions of a software humanoid phantom suggested system parameters in the physical implementation and showed that the proposed method reduced the relative mean square error of the reconstructed image in the central region of interest from 74.2% to below 1%. In preliminary physical experiments on the standard evaluation phantom, this error was reduced from 31.8% to 2.3%, and it was also demonstrated that the algorithm has no noticeable impact on the resolution of the reconstructed image in spite of the filter-based approach. Although the proposed scatter correction technique was implemented for X-ray CT, it can also be used in other X-ray imaging applications, as long as a primary modulator can be inserted between the X-ray source and the imaged object","Year":2006,"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016177"}]
