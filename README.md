# SEO_HIF_JS

SEO_HIF_JS is a search engine optimization (SEO) tool that takes into account human implicit feedback to rank search results. The tool currently includes clicks on web pages as feedback to rank search results for a session. In the future, the tool aims to include additional feedback such as time spent on websites, previous history, location, and more.

## Usage

To use the SEO_HIF_JS tool, you will need to download the repository and host it on a web server. Once hosted, you can access the tool by navigating to the hosted URL in your web browser.

## Future Development

In the future, the SEO_HIF_JS tool aims to include additional implicit feedback such as time spent on websites, previous history, location, and more. The tool also aims to improve the algorithm used to rank search results based on implicit feedback.
